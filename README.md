# UnityRuntimeDebugDraw
According to jagt's https://github.com/jagt/unity3d-runtime-debug-draw , this is a modified version of RuntimeDebugDraw .

I add some new features, eg: DrawBox, DrawCircle, DrawSphere.

You can  DrawLine/DrawRay /DrawBox/DrawCircle/DrawSphere / DrawText for DEBUGGING in Game view , works  both in built PC/mobile And unity editor.

# How to USE
1. Add 'RuntimeDebugDrawDriver.cs' to a GameObject in your scene.
2. Add `_DEBUG` symbol to your project's debugging symbol so these draw calls will be compiled away in final release builds.
3. Have fun!
